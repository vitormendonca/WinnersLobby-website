                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sport of soccer (called football in most of the world) is considered to be the world's most popular sport. In soccer there are two teams of eleven players. Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands, they can only kick, knee, or head the ball to advance it or score a goal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soccer is played at all levels throughout the world from small kids leagues to professional and international teams. Perhaps the most famous soccer tournament is the World Cup. Held every four years, the World Cup is a soccer competition among countries and is one of the most watched events in the world. Many people consider soccer at its highest level to be so beautiful as to be practically an art form. The skill at which great players and great soccer teams work the ball, strategize, and flow as one can be an awesome thing to watch.</p>
